Over the last weeks, we've changed our team's focus from technical solutions to user needs. This is so that we can:

- understand the needs of different users
- identify how the service benefits each user
- make improved and user-centred decisions

## Speaking with users

I recently conducted one-to-one user interviews and observation sessions. I spoke with five users who'd never used the kit before and two "novice users" who rated themselves with minimal experience. No one had used version 13.

We used this approach when researching people using the Kit for the first time, and particularly those who are not used to coding. As a team we do not know enough about these first interactions.

We tested our tutorial to understand more about our new users, identify pain points and find opportunities for improvement.

In general, we heard that these users really liked version 13 of the kit.

However, we discovered that there is a dip in user satisfaction, specifically around the installation of the Kit and understanding relevant software (like Node).

As the user moves along the journey, they rapidly build up confidence and satisfaction, particularly as they start to see the changes made to their Prototype.

We identified many pain points along the journey, giving us an opportunity to improve the Prototype Kit.   Many of these pain points have been reduced or removed by improving our content.  

## **Improving our content**

The content within our service is split into 2 main areas, including our:

- tutorial - to handhold brand new users through setting up the kit and building a basic prototype
- guides - which cover more specific and advanced topics

Alongside our user research, we audited all of our existing content and combined the findings to make our pages and guides simpler and clearer. 

Setting up the kit is quite technical and is one of our biggest pain points. To help users, we branched out the set up journey for each operating system (Mac, Windows and Linux). This means that each page in the set up: 

- has less content
- only has content that is relevant to the user
- is specific and direct for each step

We identified other ways to improve the tutorial across various pages, which includes:

- reducing the amount of code within each block, to help users gain confidence when coding
- updating content that refers to older versions of the kit
- explaining what technical terms mean (we often assumed knowledge by using jargon, which can be intimidating)
- providing opportunities to learn more about an unfamiliar topic (for example, HTML and CSS)
- navigating users to the right place in their kit

We also published new guides to cover topics that users often struggle with in user research or via support queries. We created a guide to explain the advantages of using Nunjucks and how to edit components, as well as how to create branching journeys.
