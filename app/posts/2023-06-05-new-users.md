Over the last weeks, we've started to changed our team's focus from technical solutions to user needs. This is so that we can

- understand the needs of different users
- identify how the service benefits each user
- make improved and user-centred decisions

## Speaking with users
I recently conducted one-to-one user interviews and observation sessions. I spoke with five users who'd never used the kit before and two "noivice users" who rated themselves with minial experience. No one had used version 13.

We used this approach when researching people using the Kit for the first time, and particularly those who are not used to coding.  As a team we do not know enough about these first interactions.

We tested our tutorial to understand more about our new users, identify pain points and find opportunities for improvement.

In general, we heard that these users really liked version 13 of the kit.

However, we discovered that there is a dip in user satisisfaction, specifically around the installation of the Kit and understaning relevant software (like Node).

As the user moves along the journey, they rapidly build up confidence and satisfaction, particularly as they start to see the changes made to their Prototype.
