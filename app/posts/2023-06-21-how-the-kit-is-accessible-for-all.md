Our goal for this sprint was to understand more about how accessible the Kit was and to identify pain points and find opportunities for improvement. 

## Testing with assistive technology


I conducted one-to-one interviews and obrsatio sessions.  I spoke with 3 visually impaired users, 2 neurodiverse users and an external auditor.  The visually impaired users were all using assistive technology to access the KIt (JAWS, NVDA and Zoomtext). Prior to the user testing, our interaction designer had also already conducted an internal WCAG audit.  

From over 12 hours of testing, I collated 87 key quotes and 183 key observations, which gave us many ways we can improve the Kit.  However, importantly, there were no blockers found.  All the users could access the Kit and create a prototype.  Considering our users were using screen readers or magnification software, this was a significant achievement, and showed us that the Kit was accessible.  

## **User Feedback**

We recieved positive feedback around the ease of use of the tutorials and templates, as well as comments that it improves productivity and is a good platform to use.  

I collated feedback and improvements on certain aspects of the tutorials, which has been passed on to the content and interaction designer, who will be working through these changes.  Most of them were minor changes with the wording or layout of the screens.
